In this dedicated branch for the IoT component codes, there are two main files:

1) intrusion_detection_ultrasonic_sensor\intrusion_detection_ultrasonic_sensor.ino (This is the ESP32 code and needs to be in its own separate folder, same name as the file given, in order to view the file)
2) intruder_image.py (This is the Python script to run the yolov5 model to do human face detection and to run the webcam)
